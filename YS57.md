# HOW 2 HACK
> Your Sinclair 57 (September 1990) - Page 45

**As promised, this month
JON NORTH explains what
decrypters are, and how to
crack a simple one. (Well, simple-ish...)**

## Decrypters? What the..?
When a loading system loads it appears
as a big block of data on tape. Within
this data is, say, 20 or 30 bytes of
runnable machine code and loads and
loads of garbage. The runnable
machine code takes the garbage, byte
by byte, and changes it into something
else. Part or all of this new data will be
some more machine code, and, eventually,
it will all be runnable, in which case you've
found the loading system.

## Why Bother?
As you saw last month, to put POKEs into
a protected game you need to make the
computer load it in, then go back to your
hack to put in the infinite lives (or
whatever) POKE. To do that, you need to
change the JP to the game in the loading
system, which means having access to it.
And, surprise surprise, to get access
you need to crack the decrypter(s) in
front of it.

## How do you recognise one?
A decrypter will change bytes in memory. A
simple example would be `POKE addr,PEEK addr+4`, although in practice they are usually more complex than that.
We saw in the first column that PEEK is
denoted in machine code by brackets, so
you are looking for brackets, and the end
of the loop will be a JP, JR or RET followed
by Z or NZ.

### The R register
This is a special register
which is very often used in
decrypters. Alkatrazz and the various
Speedlocks use it, as well as a lot of
others. Every time a machine code
instruction is executed the R register goes
up. It's possible to calculate how much it
goes up by: `XOR A` increments A by one.
but `LD IX,23000` increments A by two.
Therefore, if you start a decrypter with 
`LD A,200: LD RA` then you can reference the
value of A (and decrypt with it) at any point
until you actually resume loading.

### Trailing decrypters
These decrypters work out the number to
put in memory by using the last number
put in memory. For instance, it is known
that if 44 has just been put in memory then
the next number will be PEEK address-44
(or whatever the instruction says - it may
be PEEK address+44). If you are having
trouble understanding that lot (it's a bit
tricky trying to put it into words), I'll be
giving practical examples of each type over
the next couple of months.

### A Useful Routine
When hacking a protected game it is more
than likely that it'll crash if you try to load it
and then return to Basic. The following
routine will cause a NEW to 6400 (I've
never seen a game where the code from
4000 to 6400 is needed to get infinite
lives), so you can return to Basic making
hacking easier. Sometimes (as with the
Zolyx example) the game is loaded at one
point in memory. but is moved to
somewhere else, Keep a look-out for that
before you hack the game itself. Generally.
if the JP to the game is very low (say,
5B00-6000) or very high (FA00-FFFF) the
game will be moved. `DI; XOR A; LD DE,6400` 
(change this if you want, but not
lower than about 5000): `JP 11CB`.

### Adios!
Sorry I didn't have enough space to crack
Bleepload - I'll do it next month, honest! In
the meantime, why not try it yourself?
(Here's a clue - it does the same thing 46
times then prints a picture!) If you hit any
problems, or, for that matter, have any
ideas of your own, then drop a line to Jon
North, How 2 Hack, VS, 30 Monmouth
Street, Bath, Avon BA1 2AP. If you send
an sae you'll definitely get a reply, if you
don't you definitely won't. (I'm generous.
but not that generous.)
Oh, and before I go, I'd just like to say
"Thanks!" to the incredibly generous Mr
Giles Hopson of Sutton in Surrey. without
whose Speccy I wouldn't have been able
to write this month's column.

### Example
Zolyx (and countless other
Covergames)
Load the basic and see what
you get:  
`Zolyx LINE 0 LEN 142`

Now 'List it, remembering
that 0 is the first line
executed:
```basic
10 PAPER 0: INK O: BORDER 0: CLEAR 32767
20 LOAD "" CODE 65024
30 RANDOMIZE USR 65024
40 POKE 23418,84
50 SAVE "Zolyx" LINE 0
60 LOAD "Mast0"
```
So we know to `CLEAR 32767`, and that the loader
runs from address 65024.  
Load the code in and
disassemble from 65024:

```assembly
FE00 DI
FE01 LD HL.FE80
FE04 XOR A
FE05 LD R,A
FE07 LD A,R
FE09 XOR (HL)
FE0A LD (HL),A
FEOB INC HL
FEOC LD A,H
FEOD OR L
FEOE JP NZ,FE07
FE11 JP FE80
```

The DI simply stops A getting
corrupted. It stands tor
Disable Interrupts, which in
English means that the
processor doesn't stop every
50th of a second to read the
keyboard. HL is then set to
FE80, and A and A are set to
O. The loop itself starts now.
A is set to the value of A
(which, remember, is
constantly changing), and this
is then X0Red with PEEK
(XOR is a logical
function, and is used in the
same way as you would use
ADD or SUBtract.) The new
value is then put back into
memory with the LD (HI),A
instruction. and HI
incremented (has 1 added to
it), so it points to the next
address in memory. ID A.H.
OR L is just a way of seeing it
HL-0 If it does not, it JPs to
FE07. and does the same
thing all over again with the
next address on memory. If HL
does equal 0, it JPs to FE80
Incidentally, doing INC HI
when HL.FFFF makes HL
equal O. So we know that this
particular decrypter changes
every byte in memory from
FE80 to FFFF inclusive. To
crack it, we want to make
come back to Our hack once
it has done all its decrypting.
so you can POKE FE11 with
C9 (for RET). Try it directly in
Basic - you'll see it crashes
That's because of the DI right
at the start To overcome this,
simply Enable the Interrupts
(the El instruction), which you
can do by POKEing FEll
with FES and FE12 with C9.
After it has done its decrypter
JPs to FE80. I won't go into
detail here because I covered
headerless files last month,
but here's a summary of the
routine at FE80,
FE80-FE8F makes the
screen black: FE90-FEA3
loads the two game blocks,
and FEA4-FE131 moves the
routine at FEB2 to 6000 and
JPs to it The routine is 50
bytes long FEB2-FEBF
moves the game from FDFF
to FFFF, and JPs to it The
game is 5001 bytes long.
Change the 8000 at FEBE
to something convenient to
put POKES in.
