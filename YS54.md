# HOW 2 HACK

**After about five years hacking his way into just about every Speccy game going, JON NORTH (aka The Axxman and numerous other aliases) has decided to come clean and tell
the world how it's done. Apparently it’s been causing quite a stir in hacking circles! Take it away, Jon…**

Hi, welcome to the start of our (sort of) limited series on the fine art of hacking. Over the next few months I’ll be showing you how to hack infinite lives and energy out of almost any game you could mention and also how to crack just about every protection system. Phew!

We're going to do it in a series of lessons, with each one covering a different aspect of the noble art, and lots of examples cropping up along the way to give some practical demonstrations.  
Hopefully you'll be able to follow it! Generally the plan is to keep things as simple as possible. You won't need an in-depth knowledge of Machine Code to cope, although a working grasp of it would be very useful - try a book like [Spectrum Machine Language For The Absolute Beginner](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/2000363/Book/Spectrum_Machine_Language_for_the_Absolute_Beginner) from [Melbourne House](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/list?label_id=9522) (though you may find it difficult to get hold of - Virgin Games, who now own that label, certainly don't have any in stock or any ideas about where to get hold of a copy). You'll also need a good idea of how hexadecimal works. I'll be concentrating mainly on old YS Smash Tape games, so hopefully you won't have to shell out too much on new games to join in. With a bit of luck not too many of you will get totally lost along the way, but we shall see.

### What you need
First and foremost, you’ll need a disassembler, preferably one which you can load anywhere. [HiSoft’s Devpac](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/8091/ZX-Spectrum/HiSoft_Devpac) springs to mind, but there are plenty of others – check out the small adds in the On Spec classifieds section at the back of the magazine. If you want to find pokes for protected games before I’ve gone through the protection system you’ll also need a [Multiface](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/1000275/Hardware/Multiface_1) with the Genie disassembler program (available from Romantic Robot – see the contact box at the end of the page). Finally, and most importantly, you’ll need (a lot of) time, determination and patience. You won’t find pokes within a second of looking for them – not yet anyway.

### How to Hack
There are three ways of hacking out an infinite lives poke – they’re known as working forwards, working backwards and not working at all! This month we’ll look at working forwards – the other two next issue (with luck).

### Working Forwards
First of all, find the number of lives you’re given (say, five). Your disassembler should have a Find or Search option, so use that to look in the code for the sequence `3E 05 3D` (where 05 is the number of lives). This is hex for the machine code instruction `LD A, 05` which is similar to the Basic command `LET a=5`. The `3D` is the code for instruction `LD (address), A`. The brackets signify `PEEK`, so this instruction corresponds to Basic’s `POKE` address, `a`. Write down all the addresses you find. Now do the same, but using lives+1 and lives-1. For example, if you have five lives look for `3E 04 3D` and `3E 06 3D`.

Now for the trial and error part – the most time-consuming bit. For this you’ll ideally need a Multiface. `POKE` each value of five you’ve found, one by one, with a different value, say two or three. Eventually you’ll find the one that gives you two or three lives. If you don’t have any success, try repeating the whole procedure, but this time looking for number of lives + or - 1, ie search for four and six. You should now have found the ‘number of lives’ `POKE`. Make a note of the address it’s put into. For instance, if the instruction after `LD A,05` was `LD (5B3A),A` then the address you need to know is `5B3A`. This is called the ‘lives store’, and is what you need to look for next. Search for `21` address or `3A` address. Note that the address should be entered starting with the second two digits, then the first two. In this example, search for `21 3A 5B` or `3A 3A 5B`. Note down every value you find, then disassemble them.

For every `21` you check, the instruction you want to find is `DEC (HL)`. `DEC` implies ‘subtract 1’, and ‘(HL)’ signifies `PEEK HL`, ie `POKE HL, PEEK HL-1`. Note the addresses of every one you find. Similarly, when you check `3A`, look for `DEC A` and `SUB n`, where `n` is a number between 1 and 255 (but usually between 1 and 20).

`3A` is code for `LD A, (address)`. After the `DEC A` or `SUB n` you should find `LD (address), A` where the address is the lives store. If not, you can ignore the `DEC` or `SUB` because they have no effect. If you find several of `DEC A, DEC (HL)` or `SUB n` instructions, jot them all down. They will be for loss of life at different points in the game. For instance one may be for Level One and another for Level Two.

Now for the good bit – `POKE` all the addresses you’ve written down for `DEC (HL)` or `DEC A` with `0`. `POKE` any `SUB n’s` you’ve found to read `SUB 0` (`POKE` the address after the `SUB` instruction with `0`), then play the game. Infinite lives should be yours. Note that when you try the game with the POKEs in place you may get just one life before the ‘Game Over’ message. If this happens, just replace all the POKEs with `182` for `DEC (HL)` and `183` for `DEC A`. This is code for `OR (HL)` and `OR A`. I’m not sure why this happens, but it isn’t important. (It’s to do with flags. Smart-Alec Jonathan)

Whew! Still with us? Good. (It’s quite heavy going, isn’t it?) Still, that lot should keep you out of trouble for a month or two.

### Example
#### A Nightmare On Robinson Street
(YS Smash Tape 27, Issue 50)

You get 50 life points at the start of the game, so search for `32 32 3A` (`3A` being the hex for 50). There are two, one at `C2E1` and the other at `C322`. The one at `C322` does nothing, the other gives ‘x’ amount of life points. The instruction after the one at `C2E1` is `LD (D310), A` so you know that the lives are stored at `D310`. Now look for `3A 10 D3`. There are four – at `C3B0`, `D00D`, `D36E` and `DB47`. The code at `C3B0` reads:

```
LD A, (D310) ; (A is the value in the lives store)
CP 0 ; (Compare with 0)
JP Z, DE4B ; (If it is, Jump to address DE4B. This is the same as GOTO)
```

There are no `DEC A`s here, so ignore it. The code at `D00D` reads:

```
LD A, (D310)  ; (A is the value in the lives store)
CP 0          ; (Compare with 0)
RET Z         ; (Return if it is. This is similar to RETURN in Basic)
DEC A         ; (Aha!)
LD (D310), A  ; (Put the new value back in the lives store)
RET           ; (And return)
```

You should `POKE` the `DEC A` with `0`. The address is `D013`. The code at `D36E` is:

```
LD A, (D310)  ; (A is the value in the lives store)
LD (D34A), A  ; (Let d=a=48)
SUB E         ; (Let a=d-e=48) 
JR C, D3F4    ; (Jump forward if less than 0)
INC D         ; (Let d=d+1)
JP D3ED       ; (GOTO address D3ED)
```

This does nothing. Although there is a `SUB E` here, it is not put back into the lives store and can be ignored. The code at `DB47` reads:

```
LD A, (D310)  ; (A is the value in the lives store)
SUB 4         ; (Subtract 4)
LD (D310), A  ; (Put the new value back in the lives store)
JP NC, DB37   ; (Jump to DB37 if greater than 0)
XOR A         ; (Otherwise A=0)
LD (D310), A  ; (Put 0 in the lives store)
JP DB37       ; (And jump to DB37)
```

The `SUB 4` should be `POKE`d to read `SUB 0`. The `SUB` instruction is at `DB4A`, but the 4 which you want to change, is three addresses down. This is `DB48`. So for infinite lives. `POKE` `D013, 0` and there you have it!
