# HOW 2 HACK

**A shift in direction this month as JON NORTH dons his balaclava to take a crack at, well, cracking protection systems...*

### Loading The First Bit
The first program on any tape is called the loader – it loads the rest of the program. To crack any protection system you must always keep track of what it’s doing.

### The *LOAD routine
This program is a special loading routine. Instead of typing `LOAD ""` to load the loader, type `RANDOMIZE USR 30000`. This will load the basic program and stop with the OK message. When it loads it displays the filename, the start line of the program (usually 0, 1 or 10) and its length.

```basic
10 REM *Load by Jon North
20 LET t•O
30 FOR fvi3e4 to 30083
40 READ a, POKE f,a
50 LET tmt+(t-29990)*a. NEXT
60 IF t<>544506 THEN STOP
70 PRINT "Data 0.K ": STOP
80 DATA 221,33.0.80.1 7
90 DATA 17,0,175,55,205
100 DATA 86,5,48,240.221
110 DATA 1 26,239.183,32,236

230 DATA 42.83,92,221.46
240 DATA 0,195.115,8
```

### Disguising Basic And Getting Past It
Unfortunately, what you see and what you get with
basic programs are not always the same thing. Type in
this one line and RUN it - `10 PRINT 10`. And 10 comes up on the screen. Now type in `LET A=-PEEK 23635+256*PEEK 23636:
POKE A+5,50`. Now list the program - it will read `10
PRINT 20`, but if you run it it still prints 10. Every time a
number is put into a program two copies of it are
stored. The first is what is listed, the second is what is
actually used.

### The 'LIST program 
This is a special list routine.
Use `RANDOMIZE USR 30085` (not LIST) to use it. It
shows you the program as it would be run, stripping
away all the disguises and revealing the true program.

```basic
10 REM *List by Jon North
20 LET t=0
30 FOR f=30085 TO 30200
40 READ a: POKE l,a
50 LET t=t+(I-30075)*a: NEXT
60 IF t<>91 9527 THEN STOP
70 PRINT "Data O.K.": STOP

```

### Headerless Files 
Data loads in two chunks - a short one, the header. which holds things like the filename, then the block itself. The role of a headerless file is to get rid of this header by holding all the info about the block (where to load it to and its length) in a machine code program.

### What A Headerless Loader Looks Like 
To load a headerless block, a short bit of code is needed...

```assembly
LD IX, start address
LD DE, length at block
LD A,FF
SCF
CALL 0556
RET or JP
```

Look at most of my more complex hacks and you'll see
they start oft with `221,33,n,n,17,n,n,62,255,55,205,86,5,48,241;` this is the code to load the basic program as
a headerless file (because it can't be MERGEd).

### Revenge Of The Mutant Cock-Ups From Hell
Bit of a cock-up in the first How 2 Hack I'm afraid - to
find the number of lives you need to search the code
for 3E nn 32, not 3E nn 3D or 3A nn 32. Sorry about
that (ahem).
