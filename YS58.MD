# HOW 2 HACK
> Your Sinclair 58 (October 1990) - Page 44

**Well, he's been promising you
it for months, but here, at last,
is JON NORTH with a complete
run-down on how to crack the
Firebird Bleepload. Stand by
your disassemblers - this is
going to be tricky...**

### The First Stage
As with any protection system. you'll
need a copy of a game with the
Bleepload on it (cracking it may be a bit
difficult otherwise). As an example. I'll
be cracking [Beach Buggy](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php?cat=96&id=479), but all the other
Bleepload games are almost identical, so
any one will do.

### The Basic Bit
First oft. 'Load the basic loader Buggy  
`LINE 10 LEN 179`. 

When 'Loaded, 'List it...  
```basic
10 REM
20 CLEAR 25500
30 BORDER 0: PAPER 0: INK 0: CLS
40 PRINT AT 1,9; PAPER 1; INK 7;
" BEACH BUGGY"
50 LOAD "Buggyl"CODE 52480
80 RANDOMIZE USR 52480
```

### The Loader (The Juicy Bit)
Load the next block (the loading system)
into 52480 and disassemble it. 52480 is
CDOO hex. Following the code down from
CD00. we see a JP (HL) at CO58. Normally
you would put a breakpoint over the JP, but
JP (HL) is a one-byte instruction, and a
breakpoint takes three bytes. What you do
in this situation is put a breakpoint over the
previous instruction, as long as you have
three spare bytes. The first instruction you
can do this on is the LD (FF15),A at CD54.
Put a breakpoint here and JP to C000;
When control returns to the disassembler.
Inspect the Z80 registers to find the value of
HI. (ie, where the JP will JP to). It is FF0A,
disassemble this and we see it holds the
instruction JP CD1B, which will go back
and load another block. Put a breakpoint at
CD1B and continue (so you can now put a
second breakpoint at CD54).The next time
control returns. HL=FF06 which is again
another JP CD1B. This will keep going on
forever, or until HL holds an instruction
other than JP CD1B. Rather than repeating
the procedure of running and executing
breakpoints, we will write a simple routine
which will do it for us.

```assembly
LD (FF15),A
INC HL
LD A.(HL)
DEC HL
CP 1B
RET Z
<breakpoint>
```

Taking one instruction at a time_ LD
(FF15),A is simply a copy of the three bytes
we are overwriting (at CD54) by passing
control to our routine. INC HL makes HL
equal to the address of the first of the two
bytes of the JP address (FIL originally holds
the value of an address containing C3,
which is Z80 code for JP). `LD A,(HL)`
makes A equal to the contents of HL
(remember the brackets). le the first byte of
the JP address. `DEC HL` returns HL to its
Original value. `CP 1B` stands for ComPare
1B. ie does A equal 1B? `RET Z` stands for
RETurn if Zero. ie return back to the loader
if A=1B. This routine can be placed
anywhere in memory. but I will put it at
CCAO, because it is close to the loader and
so is unlikely to get loaded over. It is
possible that it could, in which case we
would have to start again (but putting
the routine somewhere else).  
The final stage is to put a CALL CCAO at CD54 (in
place of the breakpoint) and return control
to the loader. Control is returneo to the
disassembler after 2E has loaded. HL
FF08. which reads JP 5D00. Disassemble
this...

```assembly
5D00 PUSH IX
5D02 CALL CD6E
5D05 CALL CE2A
5008 CP (HL)
5009 JR 15D12
5DOB LD B4O
5000 CALL CE7E
5D10 JR 5D02
5D12 015D13 POP HL
5D14 LD L.0
5016 LD DE,(FEE7)
5D1A LD A,(DE)
5D18 XOR (HL)
5D1C INC H
5D10 XOR (HL)
501E DEC H
501F LD (DE),A
5D20 INC L
5D21 INC E
5D22 JR NZ,5D1
```

A5D00 to 5D10 looks like it will load
another block (CD6E, CE2A and CE7E are
all in the loading system). The routine
501A-5023 is a decrypter. which you can
see by the use of brackets in LD A,(DE)
and, more importantly, LD (DE),A. However.
we do not know where it decrypts, as DE
has a value of the contents of FEE7 and
FEE8 (which may be loaded in that last
block), so put a breakpoint at 5D1 A and JP
CD57. (This is where we broke control from
the loading system, and is therefore where
control needs to be returned to. Rule
number one â€” always cover your tracks!)
When control comes back to you.
DE=C900. The decrypter finishes when
E=0, so this decrypter changes the code
from C900-C9FF, and DE will equal CA00
after it. Continuing the disassembly...

```assembly
5024 LD DE,(FEE7)
5028 LD HL,5D40
50213 LID A,(DE)
502C XOR (HL)
5020 ID (HL).A
5D2E INC E
5D2F INC L
5030 JR NZ.5D28
5D32 LD HL.0
5D35 LD (5C80),A
5D38 ID A.2
5D3A LD (5C68),A
```

This is all that can be disassembled at this
stage, because the routine 5024-5D31
decrypts 5D40-5DFF. Put a breakpoint at
5D3A and continue.

```assembly
5D3D LD DE,(FEE7)
51341 LD HL,(FEE9)
5D44 LD A,(0E)
5045 XOR (HL)
5D46 LD (HL),A
5047 INC HL
5048 LD B,B
5D49 JR NZ,5D44
5D4B LD A,(FEEC)
5D4E CP H
5D4F JR NZ5D44
```

Before we carry on the disassembly, put a
breakpoint at 5D44 and continue. because
HL=(FEE9) which could be a couple of
bytes after the decrypter. When control
returns, however, HL=CF00 which is
nowhere near the area in memory we are
concentrating on; Therefore, although we
didn't need to put a breakpoint there, at
least we definitely know we are safe.

```assembly
5D51 LD HL,CF00
5D54 LD DE,4000
5D57 LD BC,1B00
5D5A LDIR
5D5C LD HL.EA00
5D5F LD DE,6300
5D62 LD BC,1000
5065 LDIR
5067 LD A,30
5D69 LD BC,7
5D6C LD DE.6
506F CALL FA00
5D72 LD SP,63BF
5D75 El
5D76 CALL 28E
5079 JR Z,5D98
5D7B LD A,D
5D7C SUB E
5D7D CP 21
5D7F JR NZ,5D98
```

5051 to 5066 moves a couple of chunks of
code around (including the screen). 5067-
5071 must obviously load the rest of the
game (it is the only CALL to somewhere
other than the ROM). 5D72-5D80 sets up
the stack and interrupts (unimportant as far
as we are concerned) and JPs to 5D98 (in
the unlikely event that the JR at 5079 is
Ignored, the one at 5D7F will definitely be
executed). Disassembling 5098 (where it
JPs to) 5D98 JP B1 Fa
That's it! We've cracked Bleepload! You
can move the POKEs you've got to 5D98
from your hacking routine, and end them
with a JP BlFB to start the game. Or, if
you're actually doing some serious hacking
with the game, you can put the NEW
routine I gave you last month at 5D98, so
the game will load and then NEW, so
enabling you to hack it.

### Wasn't That Exciting?
Your very first "commercial" crack. eh?
Pretty dam mega, I'd say. Today,
Bleepload... tomorrow, Barclays! (Mmm.
